# ‚úàÔ∏è Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction

This project is an **end-to-end machine learning system** that predicts whether an airline passenger is satisfied or not, based on several travel-related and service experience features. This project uses **MLOps practices**, **LightGBM** for modeling, and tools like **MongoDB**, **TensorBoard**, **MLflow**, **DVC**, **Flask**, and **Django** for full pipeline orchestration, versioning, visualization, and deployment.

## üîç Problem Statement

Airlines want to understand factors that contribute to passenger satisfaction. With this model, we can predict satisfaction levels to help airlines improve service and operations.

---

## ‚úÖ Objective

- Build a classification model to predict **Passenger Satisfaction**.
- Follow a full **MLOps pipeline**: data ingestion ‚Üí processing ‚Üí model training ‚Üí evaluation ‚Üí versioning ‚Üí deployment.
- Track and manage experiments using **MLflow** and **TensorBoard**.
- Use **MongoDB** as a data source.
- Serve the prediction using **Flask** and a touch of **Django**.
